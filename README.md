# 👋

<!--- I am into **Data Science**, **Machine Learning Engineering**, **Software Engineering** - any **engineering** work related to AI and **approaches to Artificial Intelligence**.🤖 I also like **CUDA/GPU programming** and **App Development**; however, I have neither learned nor worked with either.🙃 Although I am not an active contributor (but I ♥️ to explore GitHub) to any personal or public projects, I am more than glad if I can help you out in any way/assist you in any way/add my energy to yours on anything!😎 -->

<!--- I have a predilection towards **Data Science, Machine Learning Engineering,** and **AI Engineering** - anything related to **AI** and **its various approaches**! 🤖 Although I haven't formally learned or worked with **CUDA/GPU programming** & **App Development**, these areas still spark my interest.--> While I am not an active contributor to any personal or public projects at the moment (though I ♥️ exploring GitHub), I'm always open to **assisting and collaborating** in any way I can. If you need help or want to **combine energies on something**, feel free to reach out! 😎
